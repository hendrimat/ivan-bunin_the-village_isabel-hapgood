				<p>Opposite the house, with their rear to Durnovka, to the wide ravine, stood the storehouses. From the porch, half of the village was visible, and beyond the storehouses the pond and a part of the promontory⁠—one windmill and the schoolhouse. The sun rose to the left, beyond the fields, beyond the railway line on the horizon. In the morning the pond glittered with a bright, fresh exhalation, and from the park behind the house was wafted an odour of foliage from evergreens and leaf trees, steppe grass, apples, and dew. The rooms were small and empty. In the study, papered with old music sheets, rye was stored; in the hall and the drawing-room no furniture was left save a few Viennese chairs with broken seats and a large extension table. The windows of the drawing-room overlooked the park, and during almost the entire autumn Kuzma passed the night in it, on a broken-down couch, without closing the windows. The floor was never swept: the widow Odnodvorka lived there temporarily, in the capacity of cook; she had been the mistress of young Durnovo, and was obliged to run after her small children and prepare food, after a fashion, for herself, Kuzma, and the labourer. Kuzma himself prepared the samovar in the morning, after which he sat at the window in the hall and drank tea and ate apples.</p>
				<p>Through the early glitter, beyond the brilliant mist over the ploughed fields, the railway train dashed past in the morning; and, above, rose-coloured wreaths floated behind it. Dense smoke hung over the roofs of the village. The garden was freshly fragrant; silvery hoarfrost lay upon the storehouses. At noon the sun stood over the village; it was hot out of doors; in the park the maples and lindens grew thin, quietly dropping their leaves; the vast spaces and the transparent dry air of the fields were filled with silence and with peace. The doves, warmed up by the sun, dozed all day long on the sloping roof of the kitchen, whose new straw roof gleamed yellow against the clear blue sky. The labourer rested after his dinner. Odnodvorka went off to her own home.</p>
				<p>But Kuzma roamed about. He went to the threshing-floor, rejoicing in the sun, the firm road, the withered steppe grass, the beet-tops which had turned dark brown, the charming late flower of the blue chicory, and the down of the cotton thistle floating quietly through the air. The ploughed spaces in the fields gleamed in the sunlight with the silken threads of barely visible spiders’ webs, which extended to an immense distance. In the vegetable garden, goldfinches perched on the dry stalks of the burdocks. Upon the threshing-floor, amid the profound stillness in the sultry heat, grasshoppers diligently emitted their hoarse cry.</p>
				<p>From the threshing-floor Kuzma climbed across the earthen well and returned to the manor-house through the orchard and the fir plantation. In the orchard he chatted with the petty burghers, the lessees of the orchard, with the Bride and the Goat, who were gathering up the windfalls, and forced his way, in their company, into the nettle patch where lay the ripest fruit of all. Sometimes he wandered to the village, to the schoolhouse. He became freshened up, sunburned; he felt himself almost happy.</p>
				<p>The Goat amazed him by her health, her cheery stupidity, her senselessly brilliant Egyptian eyes. The Bride was handsome and strange. With him, as with Tikhon, she remained silent; not a word was to be got out of her. But when one went away she gave vent to a harsh laugh, indulged in bawling conversations with the petty burghers, and would suddenly strike up:</p>

				<p>The soldier-teacher, born stupid, had lost in the service what small wits he had ever possessed. In appearance he was the most commonplace sort of peasant, about forty years of age. But he always spoke in such an extraordinary manner, and uttered such nonsense, that all one could do was to throw up one’s hands in despair. He was forever smiling with the greatest appearance of slyness at something or other; he looked down upon his interlocutor condescendingly, with his eyes screwed up, and never replied to any question immediately.</p>
				<p>“How am I to address you?” Kuzma asked him the first time he visited the school.</p>
				<p>The soldier blinked and considered the matter. “The sheep without a name might be a ram,” he said at last, at his leisure. “But I will ask you something also. Is Adam a name, or is it not?”</p>
				<p>“It is.”</p>
				<p>“Very well. And about how many people, for example, have died since then?”</p>
				<p>“I don’t know,” said Kuzma. “Why do you inquire?”</p>
				<p>“Simply because that’s one of the things we never were born to understand. Now, take any busybody you like. Do you indulge in revolt? Do it, my dear man: perhaps you will become a <em>fit</em>-marshal! Only, at best, that they may stretch you out without your breeches for a flogging. Are you a peasant? Till the soil. Are you a cooper? In that case, equally, attend to your business. I, for example, am a soldier and a veterinary. Not long ago I was passing through the Fair, and what should I see but a horse with the glanders? I went at once to the policeman: ‘Thus and so,’ says I, ‘Your High Wellborn.’ ‘But can you kill that horse with a feather?’ ‘With the greatest pleasure!’ ”</p>
				<p>“With what sort of a feather?” inquired Kuzma.</p>
				<p>“Why, a goose feather. I took it, sharpened it, jabbed it into his spinal cord, blew a little⁠—into the feather, I mean⁠—and the thing was done. ’Tis a simple matter, to all appearance, but just try to do it!” And the soldier winked craftily and tapped his brow with his finger: “Understanding is needed here.”</p>
				<p>Kuzma shrugged his shoulders and made no reply. And as he passed Odnodvorka’s cottage he found out from her boy Senka what the soldier’s name was. It turned out to be Parmen.</p>
				<p>“And what’s your task for tomorrow?” added Kuzma, gazing with curiosity at Senka’s fiery red mop of hair, his lively green eyes, his pockmarked face, his rickety little body, and his hands and feet all cracked with mud and chaps.</p>
				<p>“The tasks are verses,” said Senka, grasping his uplifted foot in his right hand and hopping up and down on one spot.</p>
				<p>“What sort of tasks?”</p>
				<p>“Counting the geese. A flock of geese has flown past⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Ah, I know,” said Kuzma. “And what else?”</p>
				<p>“Also mice⁠—”</p>
				<p>“They are to be counted too?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. Six mice were walking along carrying six copper coins,” mumbled Senka rapidly, casting a sidelong glance at Kuzma’s silver watch chain. “One mouse, which was bigger, carried two coins. How many does that make in all⁠—?”</p>
				<p>“Splendid. And what are the verses?”</p>
				<p>Senka released his foot.</p>
				<p>“The verses are ‘Who is he?’ ”</p>
				<p>“Have you learned them?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>
				<p>“Well, then, say them.”</p>
				<p>And Senka muttered still more rapidly about a horseman who was riding above the Neva through the forests, where there were only⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>“ ‘Firs, pine-trees, and green moss. …’ ”</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>“Grey,” said Kuzma, “not green.”</p>
				<p>“Well, then, grey,” assented Senka.</p>
				<p>“And who was that horseman?”</p>
				<p>Senka considered the matter. “Why, a sorcerer,” said he.</p>
				<p>“Exactly. Now, tell your mother that she ought to cut your hair, on your temples at least. ’Tis all the worse for you as it is, when the teacher pulls it.”</p>
				<p>“Then he’ll find my ears,” said Senka unconcernedly, again grasping his foot, and off he hopped on the pasture common.</p>
